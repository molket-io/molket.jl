    "Control gates are defined depending taking the least significant bit (LSB) or the most significant bit (MSB). It also can be indicated whether the quantum framework is using `little-endien` or `big-endien`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit by uses `little-endian` for both classical bit ordering and qubit ordering. That is the most significant bit (MSB) is on the left and the least significant bit is on the right (LSB). This is the standard binary sequence order. In this situation, the index of qubits starts from the right. That is the most right qubit is $q_{0}$. For example, for the case $|0 1 \\rangle$, the LSB is 1 and MSB is 0. \n",

    "`little-endian` in Qiskit means the qubits are represented from the MSB on the left to the LSB on the right. \n",

    "`big-endien` in most of textbooks and our package means the qubits are represented from the LSB on the left to the MSB on the right.\n",
    "\n",

    "This different from the default physics notion of `big-endien` where the LSB qubit is on the left and the MSB is on the right. This is the case of most textbooks. This has no effect on the construction of single qubit gates. However, for two-qubit and multi-qubit gates, this will change the matrix representation of some gates like the control gates for example as well as the location of the control and the target qubits. \n",
